(An authentic, high-energy photo of the person from the provided image, with their exact facial features and likeness perfectly preserved). They are elegantly styled as a modern vampire, captured in the middle of a crowded, vibrant Halloween party. The costume is a sophisticated, tailored black velvet tuxedo with a high-collared cape. They wear realistic-looking, subtle prosthetic fangs. The person is laughing heartily, revealing their fangs in a moment of genuine fun, perhaps with a friend's arm thrown happily around their shoulder. Lighting: The scene is lit with a powerful on-camera direct flash, creating sharp shadows and vibrant colors. Background: A lively, crowded party. In the immediate background, a table is visible with glowing carved Halloween pumpkins and platters of spooky treats like 'witch finger' cookies and ghost-shaped cookies. Friends in other costumes are laughing nearby, and confetti is captured mid-air. 8K, realistic, candid feel. Final instruction for background: The guests should be in a variety of classic Halloween costumes (e.g., ghosts, mummies, skeletons), but specifically avoid any clowns or circus themes.
